> The goals of cv

* Grouping: Divide the scene into objects
* Recognition
* Recognition, Reconstruction and Reogranization

> Camera

* Projection
* Vanishing point

> Homogenous Coordinates - projective geometry (Cartesian for Euclidean geometry)
n + 1(map from homogenous coordinate to cartesian coordinate)
