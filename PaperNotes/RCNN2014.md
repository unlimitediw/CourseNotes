> What it wants to do

* To what extent do the CNN classification results on ImageNet generalize to object detection results on the PASCAL VOC Challenge.
* Challenge 1: units high up makes precise localization within the sliding window paradigm an open technical challenge. Solution:"Recognize using region"
* Challenge 2: labeled data is scarce and the amount currently available is insufficient for training a large CNN. Solution: use unsupervised pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning.

> Object detection with R-CNN

* Three modules: 
  * generate category-independent region proposals(define the set of candidate detections available to the detector) - [selective search](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/isis/publications/2013/UijlingsIJCV2013/UijlingsIJCV2013.pdf)
  * a large CNN that extracts a fixed-length feature vector from each region
    * convert the image data in that region into fixed 227x227 mean-subtracted RGB image
  * a set of class specific linear SVMs

* Test-time detection
  * parameters sharing
  * low dimension

* Training
  * Supervised pre-training: image level annotation(rather than bounding box)
  * Domain-specific fine-tuning: adapt the CNN model to new detection and domain(wrapped proposal windows)
    * SGD using only wrapped regions proposals
    * Treat all region proposals with >= 0.5 intersection over unions.
  * Object category classifiers
    * Solve partitial overlap problem with IoU overlap threshold.
    * Once feature extracted, optimze a linear SVM for each class.
